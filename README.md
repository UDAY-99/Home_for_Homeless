# Home_for_Homeless
To develop a centralized web platform that connects homeless individuals (through the help of users) with registered care institutions such as orphanages, old-age homes, and shelters. The platform will also allow donations to these institutions, thus supporting their operations and ensuring the well-being of the homeless.
